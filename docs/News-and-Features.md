 + supports annotation of a region based on a transcript-dependent characterization
 + supports mutations at both coding region and intronic/UTR regions
 + supports noncoding RNA annotation
 + supports VCF inputs
 + supports long haplotype decomposition
 + supports single nucleotide variation (SNV), insertions and deletions (indels) and block substitutions
